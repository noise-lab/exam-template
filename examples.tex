What is the initial average throughput of the TCP connection, based only
on the portion of the trace shown above? Give your answer in megabits per
second; {\bf an approximate answer is fine, since the calculation is not
round}. 
%(Feel free to show your work as a fraction outside of the answer
%box for potential partial credit.)

    % $\frac{11587/0.07} \cdot 8$ = 
    \shortanswerbox{1}{$\approx 1.3$} Mbps.
